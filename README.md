# Crop Disease Identification and Management with Machine Learning

## Project Aim and Objectives
- Review literature on similar scholarly publications
- Collect data on diseases affecting tomato and pepper crops
- Train and develop a Machine Learning Model to aid the identification and management of crop diseases
- Build a Mobile App for the Model
- Test the Model


## METHODOLOGY AND IMPLEMENTATION
Every general machine learning task including deep learning has a standardized approach which needs to be followed in order to obtain the best results. This is known as the Machine Learning workflow which is shown below:

### DATA COLLECTION
**Description of Dataset**
The PlantVillage dataset, an openly accessible resource, features a variety of plant disease categories. For this project, we focused on 12 classes relevant to tomato and pepper crops, narrowing down from the original 38 classes and 54,305 images. The dataset was split into training (80%) and validation/testing (20%) subsets to ensure robust model performance.
