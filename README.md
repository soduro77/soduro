# Crop Disease Identification and Management with Machine Learning

## Project Aim and Objectives
- Review literature on similar scholarly publications
- Collect data on diseases affecting tomato and pepper crops
- Train and develop a Machine Learning Model to aid the identification and management of crop diseases
- Build a Mobile App for the Model
- Test the Model


## METHODOLOGY AND IMPLEMENTATION
Every general machine learning task including deep learning has a standardized approach which needs to be followed in order to obtain the best results. This is known as the Machine Learning workflow which is shown below:
